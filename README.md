# MachineLearning
This project consits on the analysis of a type 2 Diabetes mellitus dataset to find relationships between diabetes and other variables using machine learning approaches.

The goal of this project is to design a workflow were the methodology is built on top of the content. To do so, the project is divided in five blocks:
  1. Literature review on Diabetes mellitus.
  2. Introduction to the dataset and imputation of missing data.
  3. Explore the behavior of each variable, and interactions between variables.
  4. Modeling using WEKA and MLib.
  5. Conclusions and proposals.
